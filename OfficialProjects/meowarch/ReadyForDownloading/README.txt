Before using, read install.txt and install all you need

Launch meowarch.py from MeowArch folder, but don't copy .py file from this folder, it may crash (I think not, but what if?) meowarch, and it will not work
untill you copy file back.

Don't copy any files to MeowArch folder

If you want to test program, use files in folder "For testing MeowArch", and than use meowarch for your needs
