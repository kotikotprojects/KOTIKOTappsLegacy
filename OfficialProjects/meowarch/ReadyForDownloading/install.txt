I am guide for installation
Firstly, install Python. If you want, download latest version from official website. But I added installation file of Python 3.9
If it won't work - download from https://www.python.org/

!IMPORTANT!
Check te box "install pip"

After installing python and pip, run installEasygui.bat or in CMD print 
>>> pip install easygui
(without >>>)

Cool, your copy of MeowArch works!
